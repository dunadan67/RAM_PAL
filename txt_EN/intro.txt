  In this experiment you will study lists of 
  word pairs presented on the screen. First you
  will see a row of X's (XXXXXXX), then the pair
  will be presented one word at a time.  There 
  will be six pairs in each list.


  Following the presentation of the pairs you will 
  be shown several math problems. Answer them as 
  quickly and accurately as you can.

  When you have completed these math problems, you 
  will be presented with a series of question marks 
  (??????) and then one word from the list, either 
  the first or second word, and asked to recall 
  the matching word from the pair. Please speak 
  your response into the microphone.  If you cannot 
  remember the word, say "pass".
 
  If you have any questions about these instructions, 
  ask the experimenter now.
